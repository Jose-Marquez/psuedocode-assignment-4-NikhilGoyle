Go Fish Rules

There should be no more than 7 players
You need a 52 card deck
Each player starts the game with 7 cards
The remaining cards are placed in the center as a pool to draw from
At any point during the game, if a player has all 4 suits of a rank, called a book, then they must remove those cards from their hand and place them face-up in front of them
The game continues until either any players runs out of cards in their hand or the middle pile does not have any cards remaining
The winner is the player that has the highest number of complete books
If two or more players have an equal number of complete books, then they tie
